Documentation Report: VGG16 Image Classification for Male and Female Face Dataset

Introduction:

This documentation report provides an overview and detailed explanation of the code that implements image classification using the VGG16 architecture on a dataset containing male and female images of faces. 
The code accomplishes the following tasks:

1. Data Preparation: The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, and data augmentation techniques are applied to the training data.

2. Model Building: A pre-trained VGG16 model is loaded, and custom layers are added to perform binary classification for distinguishing between male and female faces.

3. Model Training: The model is compiled, and training is performed using the training and validation data. Early stopping is applied to prevent overfitting.

4. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the test data, and various classification metrics are calculated.

Let's dive into each section in detail:

Data Preparation

Data Directory Structure

The dataset is organized in the following directory structure:

- Data Set Contain 3 Folders

- `Train` contains training images.
- `Test` contains test images.
- `Validation` contains validation images.

Data Splitting:

The dataset is split into three parts:

- Training Data: 70% of the data
- Validation Data: 15% of the data
- Test Data: 15% of the data

Data Augmentation:

Data augmentation is performed on the training data using the `ImageDataGenerator` from TensorFlow. 
The following augmentations are applied:

- Rescaling: Images are rescaled to values between 0 and 1.
- Rotation: Random rotation of up to 40 degrees.
- Width and Height Shift: Randomly shifting the width and height by up to 20%.
- Shear Range: Random shearing.
- Zoom Range: Random zooming.
- Horizontal Flip: Random horizontal flipping.
- Fill Mode: Nearest fill mode.

Model Building:

Base Model:

The pre-trained VGG16 model is loaded with weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. 
The top classification layers of the VGG16 model are excluded.

Custom Layers:

Custom layers are added to the VGG16 base model for binary classification:

- Global Average Pooling 2D layer.
- A dense layer with 1024 units and ReLU activation.
- A final dense layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation (for binary classification).

Model Training:

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 and binary cross-entropy loss. 
The base model layers are frozen to retain the pre-trained weights. Training is performed with early stopping to prevent overfitting. 
The model is trained for a single epoch.

Model Evaluation:

The trained model is evaluated on the test data using the `evaluate` method, and accuracy is calculated. 
Additionally, the model makes predictions on the test data, and the following classification metrics are calculated:

- Accuracy : 0.85
- Precision : 0.53
- Recall : 0.61
- F1-Score : 0.57

A classification report is generated, which includes precision, recall, and F1-Score for each class (male and female).

Conclusion:

This code successfully trains and evaluates an image classification model using the VGG16 architecture on a dataset containing male and female face images. 
The code can be further extended for fine-tuning, hyperparameter tuning, or additional evaluation and analysis as needed.
